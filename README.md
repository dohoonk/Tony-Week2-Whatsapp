# WhatsApp-style Chat (Expo + Firebase)

## üë• Persona: ‚ÄúThe Trip Crew‚Äù
Digital-native groups of 4‚Äì6 friends planning weekend trips and events entirely in chat. They want decisions, reminders, itineraries, and weather handled in the same place they talk.

Key needs:
- Reduce planning chaos with quick summaries and clear next steps
- Lightweight polls for fast consensus
- Deadlines with shared reminders
- AI-generated itineraries
- Weather-aware plans across the trip window

A cross-platform chat app built with Expo (React Native) and Firebase. Supports email auth, friends with requests, direct/group chats, optimistic messaging with offline outbox, realtime presence, unread divider, and foreground notifications.

## Quality & DX goals
- Clear, comprehensive README
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Architecture overview with diagrams
- Environment variables template
- Easy to run locally
- Code is well-commented

## Monorepo Layout
```
root/
  app/            # Expo client (this README)
  app/api/        # Vercel Serverless (Node runtime)
  app/shared/     # Shared types
```

## 1) Prerequisites
- macOS with Xcode (for iOS Simulator)
- Node 20.x and npm 10.x
- Git + a GitHub repo (already configured)
- Expo CLI (via npx expo)

Optional (recommended later):
- EAS CLI for Dev Client / cloud builds

## 2) Install
```bash
cd app
npm install
```

## 3) Configure Firebase
1. Create a Firebase project (or use existing). Note your `projectId`.
2. Project settings ‚Üí Your apps ‚Üí Add app ‚Üí Web. Copy the config values.
3. Create `.env` in `app/` with EXPO_PUBLIC_ vars:
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
```
The app loads these via `app.config.ts`.

### Serverless (Vercel) env vars
Set these in Vercel ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables:
```
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=...
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
WEATHERAPI_KEY=...
```
Client also needs the API base URL:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_AI_API_URL=https://<your-vercel-domain>
```

### Firestore structure
- `users/{uid}`: displayName, photoURL, emailLower, statusMessage, online/status/lastSeen (written by app), pushTokens[]
- `friendRequests/{id}`: fromUid, toUid, status, createdAt
- `friends/{uid}/list/{friendUid}`: friendUid, addedAt
- `chats/{chatId}`: type, members[], groupName/photo, lastMessage/lastMessageAt, readStatus{uid:{id,at}}, tripId?, pollId?, reminderId?
- `chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}`: senderId, text/imageUrl, timestamp
- `presence/{uid}`: online, state, lastChanged (written by app)
- `polls/{pollId}`: question, options[], votes{uid:index}, status, resultPosted
- `reminders/{reminderId}`: chatId, title, dueAt, status
- `trips/{chatId}`: title, destination, startDate, endDate, notes, members[], version, itinerary[], archived

## 4) Run the app
Prefer Expo Go for quick start; Dev Client for richer native features (notifications etc.).

### Expo Go (quickest)
```bash
cd app
npx expo start -c
# press i to open iOS Simulator (or open Expo Go app on device)
```
If the CLI insists on a dev build, press `s` to switch to Expo Go.

### Dev Client (optional)
Use when you need full `expo-notifications` support.
```bash
cd app
npx expo prebuild -p ios
npx expo run:ios
# in another terminal
npx expo start --dev-client
```

## 5) Features and behaviors
- Auth: Email/password (Google later). Auth persistence warning is expected for now (we didn‚Äôt wire AsyncStorage yet).
- Friends: Incoming/outgoing requests and friends list update in real time; tap friend to open a direct chat.
- Presence: On login + every 10s while active, app writes `presence/{uid}` and `users/{uid}` (online/status/lastSeen). Friends screen subscribes and shows a live green dot when online.
- Chats list: All chats where you are a member, sorted by `lastMessageAt`.
- Messaging:
  - Optimistic UI: Messages render immediately with a "sending‚Ä¶" indicator.
  - Offline outbox: Failed sends are queued and auto-retried every 1s; also flushed when app returns to foreground.
  - Pagination: Loads latest 10; scroll up to fetch older messages in batches of 10.
  - Unread divider: Inserts a "New messages" banner at the first unread message on entry and scrolls near it.
  - Read state: Per-user `readStatus` (derived unread count next to own messages).
- Notifications (foreground): Global listener per chat; shows a banner for new incoming messages while app is foregrounded.
  - For the demo we gate notifications to Expo Go; Dev Client recommended for full support.

### TripMate AI (v2)
- Long‚Äëpress a message or tap the composer `+` to open AI tools: summarize, create poll, add reminder, plan trip, weather.
- Type `@TM <question>` in the composer to ask TripMate directly (e.g., `@TM what's the weather in Seattle next week?`).
  - The server supports `tool="auto"` with LLM intent extraction (strict JSON). We validate and then call deterministic tools/APIs.
- RAG window: last 200 text messages (images/AI/system excluded).
- Drafts are private until you tap Share (no writes on Discard).
- Weather uses WeatherAPI (imperial units) and now shows the resolved city name alongside daily temps and icons.

### Trips, Polls, Reminders
- Trips: single `trips/{chatId}` doc with versioning; itinerary editing and posting to chat.
- Itinerary editor: per‚Äëday City field; city precedence is day.city ‚Üí carry‚Äëforward ‚Üí title city. Weather requests are year‚Äënormalized (no historical fetches). Server returns resolved city with lat/lon and the client writes it to each day as `resolved`.
- See itinerary model and flow in `../itinerary.md`.
- Polls: one vote per user, revotes allowed; auto-close and single summary message.
- Reminders: scheduled ‚Üí notified ‚Üí completed/expired, with foreground notifications to members.

## 6) Multi-device testing
- iOS: open a second simulator
```bash
open -na Simulator
```
Open Expo Go in each simulator and load the same project URL (use Tunnel if LAN fails). Sign in as different users.

## 7) Troubleshooting
- Port in use / stuck server:
```bash
pkill -f "expo start" || true
lsof -ti tcp:8081,19000,19001,19002 | xargs kill -9 || true
```
- Clear cache / restart:
```bash
npx expo start -c
```
- Dev build prompt while you want Expo Go: press `s` to switch to Expo Go.
- Check logs (Metro): the terminal running `npx expo start`. DevTools: press `d`.
- Verify Firebase project in app logs:
  - Metro should show: `Firebase projectId <yourId>` at startup.
- Presence not turning green:
  - Ensure each user opened the app (Friends tab triggers a presence write).
  - Confirm `presence/{uid}` and `users/{uid}` fields update.
- Notifications not appearing in Expo Go:
  - Known limitation; use Dev Client for full support. In this repo we also show an in‚Äëapp banner in foreground.

### AI Debugging
- Weather path logs (server): intent JSON from LLM, parsed city/date range, WeatherAPI search/forecast URLs (redacted key), and result count.
- Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_AI_API_URL` correctly; verify Firebase Admin creds on Vercel.

## 8) Scripts
Common commands:
```bash
# Start (Expo Go)
cd app && npx expo start -c

# Start on a port
npx expo start -c --port 8090

# iOS simulator
press i in the Expo CLI, or: open -a Simulator
```

## 9) Security notes
- Start with permissive Firestore rules for MVP/testing; harden later.
- Always review rules before distributing builds.

If you run into issues, check the Metro logs first, then confirm your Firebase `projectId` matches the console you‚Äôre viewing.
